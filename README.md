# Unjumbler

Solves word jumbles. Simply compares every single combination of letters in the input to a dictionary. Could be made much faster with a heuristic approach. Code could be infinitely cleaner with a recursive method. 

To-Dos
- Use a recursive method
- Look into heuristic approaches to speed things up
  - Disregard letter combinations that don't appear in any words
  - Begin with the most common letter combinations
  - Remove dictionary words that do not contain all the same letters in the input before doing anything.
